# CoachingBuddy2.0 (DESKTOP -NON HOSTED- VERS)

## Purpose
I'm a rowing coach and as is the case with most endurance sports I have to deal with handling the very mathematical training regime of my athletes. Often times I find that I would like to have a tool at my disposal to keep track of the statistics and status of my rowers. A google doc could be super helpful and its what I currently use but I usually find it clunky and easy to loose track of information in as the workouts pile up. Also setting up ways to automatically call up progression graphs would be hugely helpful but are tough to organize properly in a doc in a quick way. So what I thought up was a google doc on roids. Coaching Buddy is planned to be a tool that you can input the workouts into and have them viewable and sortable by some parameters (just like a spreadsheet) but where we go above and beyond is the ability to then tap that data quickly and produce charts and graphs of everything an endurance coach could want (volume, pacing, PR progress, etc) and also make predictions on times and statuses. Additionally it will use a calendar feature for workout planning and recording.
